    <p> A Cinema hall is a place where movies are screened on huge screens for a mass of public in an enclosed space called the theatre.

        A cinema hall attracts crowds from all classes of the society and also from every walk of life.
        
        Young and old, rich and poor, everyone visits the cinema hall once in a while to watch their favourite movies on big screen and cheer for their favourite actor or actress.
        A Cinema Hall is a lively spot throughout the day. It is the centre of many activities. Cinema is the most popular source of entertainment for young and old alike, though the majority that goes to see the films belongs to the younger generation.


        The big hoardings and posters outside the Cinema Hall attract the attention of the movieÂ­goers. They inform about the current movie running at the hall as well as the forthcoming attractions.
        
        The rush at the ticket counter covers the window out of sight. There are long queues. Some people who are in the back of the line try to get tickets earlier by requesting those who are near the counter.</p>
