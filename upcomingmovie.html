<p><b>Story: </b>Drishyam 2 hits its stride only when the police, led by an IPS officer (Murali Gopi), swing into action.
Georgekutty is unruffled. His wife Rani (Meena) is a bundle of nerves and his traumatised elder daughter Anju (Ansiba) is a wreck.
Any talk about the unfortunate incident is therefore a strict no-no in Georgekutty's home.
The law-abiding, affable cable TV operator once drew inspiration from the movies he devoured sitting in his office.
Intelligent people do not read newspapers, he had proclaimed to his family,
a rather unusual belief to hold in a part of India where newspapers and periodicals are known to launch a thousand debates.</p>
<p> <b>Review: </b>The battle of wits between Georgekutty and the police had, for the most part, held us in thrall in Drishyam.
In the sequel, the confrontations, enlivened as they are by Murali Gopi's presence, are not quite as exciting.
It is only in the lengthy build-up to the climax that Georgekutty's clever stratagems come to the fore and give the proceedings a fillip.
The twists and turns are not only not as startling as they were the first time around,they are also way less convincing.
Drishyam, too, had taken three quarters of an hour to set itself up for the cat-and-mouse game between Georgekutty and the police IG.
But from that point on, the pace of the film had quickened.
One waits in vain for that to happen in Drishyam 2.</p>
<p>Mohanlal is flawless yet again as the husband/father who will stake his all to keep the police at bay.
The other actors in the cast, especially Murali Gopi, pull their weight.
The writing could have done with more punch.
The guessing game at the core of Drishyam 2 isn't always gripping enough.</p>
